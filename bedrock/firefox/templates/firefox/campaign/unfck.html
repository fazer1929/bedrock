    <p>That's like Oshawa winning the Stanley Cup. This is the difference between moose and Toronto Maple Leaf, eh? Drake will boot us out of Timmins and we'll have no place to sleep, eh? Ah, tell it to your pumpkin, Morley Safer. It's time Harveyâ€™s joined the 20th century.</p>

    <p>That's like Newfoundland winning the Stanley Cup. Geez, a tunnel to Quispamsis!  Take off, how convenient! In Canada, snowmobiles only go up in price. Anyone knows that. Even Gordie Howe knows that. Watch your step and remember, Avril Lavigne is watching you. It's in the Canadian Criminal Code, eh. Like there's legal loonie set in cases in law, eh?</p>

              A longer description for more detailed copy. Here we have room for several sentences,
              but try not to make a paragraph too long as this will take up more space on smaller screens.
              Copy will also be on average 1/3 longer than English when translated to different languages,
              so try to keep sentences short and concise.
